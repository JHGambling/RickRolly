# Rick Rolly

A visually appealing, web-based roulette game with a casino-style betting table, chip selection, and player budget system.

## How to use on GitHub Pages

1. Push all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `roulette.js`, etc.) to your repository's root (not in a subfolder).
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, using the `main` branch and `/ (root)` as the source.
3. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/` to play!

No build step is required. All assets are static and ready for GitHub Pages.
